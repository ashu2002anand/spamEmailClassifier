# spamEmailClassifier
 I developed a spam email classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes with 98.12% accuracy and 99.17% precision. I implemented a user-friendly interface with Streamlit for real-time spam/ham classification, hosted on a local server. Includes comprehensive testing and validation for reliable performance.
Key features of this project include:

Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier: Chosen for its efficacy in text classification tasks, this algorithm demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing between spam and ham emails. The model's training involved extensive data preprocessing, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation.

High Accuracy and Precision: Through rigorous training and evaluation, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 98.12%, ensuring most emails are correctly classified. The precision of 99.17% indicates a meagre false-positive rate, meaning legitimate emails are rarely misclassified as spam.

Streamlit Interface: The project features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, a popular framework for creating interactive web applications. This interface allows users to input email messages and receive instant classification results, enhancing usability and accessibility.

Local Server Deployment: The application is hosted on a local server, ensuring quick and efficient performance. Users can access the classifier through a web browser, input their email content, and obtain immediate feedback on whether the email is spam or ham.

Comprehensive Testing and Validation: The model underwent extensive testing to ensure robustness and reliability. Various metrics, including confusion matrix, recall, and F1 score, were used to evaluate performance, ensuring the classifier meets high standards of accuracy and dependability.
